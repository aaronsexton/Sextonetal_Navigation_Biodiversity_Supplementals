# Sextonetal_Navigation_Biodiversity_Supplementals
Research compendium to reproduce analyses and figures of the following article:
Inland navigation is a driver of freshwater biodiversity declines in Europe: https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-3316255/v1


There are three R files here which provide code to reproduce the analyses present in this manuscript.

The first is NAVIDIV Synthesis Supplemental Code.R which contains the code to run the GLMMs and RLQ Fourth Corner Analysis.

The second is Subcatchment Supplemental File.R which contains the code to run the analysis to determine which subcatchment (Pfafstetter level) we used in our GLMMs.

The third is rarity and evenness synthesis.R which contains the code to run the evenness and rare taxa follow-up analysis we conducted.



There are several csv files which contain the data necessary to run the analyses in the above code.
Additionally, all supplemental files are hosted here.
